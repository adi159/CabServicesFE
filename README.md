This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

Prerequisites 
Installation and Setup Process:
  
https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment

1. VS Code
2. Install Node.js
3. Install Java JDK 17 (for Android)
4. Install Android Studio + SDKs; set ANDROID_HOME SDK path and add platform-tools to PATH
5. Install Xcode (for iOS, on macOS)
6. Install Watchman (macOS): brew install watchman
7. Install React Native CLI: npm i -g react-native-cli 
8.Create RN app - npx @react-native-community/cli init CSAPP
9. cd CSAPP

Run Application: npm scripts in package.json

1. npm install --save-dev @react-native-community/cli
2.  npx react-native start 
3. npx react-native run-android
3. npm install
4. npx react-native clean
5. npm start --reset-cache

Enable Development mode for mobile application:
1. Go to link: chrome://inspect/#devices
2. Click on Discover USB devices
3. Open project android folder in android studio and lets complete grade file sync


VS Code Extension:
1. ES lint
2. React Native CLI
3. Prettier
4. TypeScript 


> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npx
npx react-native start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npx
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
